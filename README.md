This is a web-based GLSL editor. There are many different web-based GLSL editors out there, but I've found that not many of them have a friendly interface. Most also don't support more advanced features, such as uploading your own models & textures.

There needs to be some kind of web-based GLSL editor that quickly allows you to mock up some ideas you might have for a vert or frag shader. This is the aim of this project.

## Demo
You can try the demo out [here](https://blewert.github.io/webglsl-editor/).

## Installation
To install, clone this repo and run `npm install`. You can then use `start.bat` (on Windows) or `npm run start` to start the editor in development mode.

## Versioning
The current version is `0.0.2`. The GLSL editor consists of a blank tabbed text-editor and some functionality: shaders can be edited, and the 3D view updates. No errors are alerted.
